            <p>Our green thumb emerged while working a 1000 sq ft plot.  That summer yielded a bounty that produced litres of tomato sauce and pesto, bushels of beets, carrots, kale and zucchini and the largest watermelon haul North York had ever seen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2016, we began growing gardens in backyards across the city.  From Etobicoke to Roncesvalles, Mid-Town and down to the Beaches, lucky homes were filled with natures bounty and pollinators.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The following year, we found the ideal situation - two greenhouses in Scarborough named Gurr Block Greenhouses.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We met Bob Gurr and he told us the story of his family business. Since 1947, his family has operated Gurr Block Greenhouses, from a cement factory to greenhouses with his dad in the mid 70’s. We are happy to continue and uphold the tradition the Gurr’s started, adding our own spin of course. :)</p>
